# Non-Intrusive-Load-Management
Machine Learning model for finding user's appliance level data based on smart meter data.

The given model is trained on the [REFIT dataset](https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/datasets/refit-electrical-load-measurements). Once the dataset is downloaded, the steps from **Extracting Variables** can be followed. 

In the uploaded Ipynb data from *House 2* of the REFIT dataset is analyzed , but the given model can be used to learn the data from any appliance in any house:
